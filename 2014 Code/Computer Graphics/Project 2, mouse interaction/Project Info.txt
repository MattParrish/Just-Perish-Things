The second homework for Computer Graphics! This one the assignment was to create something that utilized clicking and dragging an object.

This program features another 2D scene, this one with clouds of varying sizes moving down the screen, and a small red airplane you can click and drag around on the screen. Also in the bottom right is a slider that will adjust the speed at which the clouds are flying by.
