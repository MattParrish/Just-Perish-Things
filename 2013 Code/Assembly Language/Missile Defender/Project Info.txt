This was a project I did with a friend for Assembly Language Programming. The project was a vague 'do something using assembly'.
We decided to recreate Missile Command using Assembly. 

How to play:
Click and hold to create an explosion in the air, which will destroy incoming missiles.
Once the boss appears, shoot him down too!

Tips:
If you really want, you can just click and hold the explosion directly over one city, and you'll never lose.
Once the boss appears, simply click and hold the explosion over him, and he loses health every screen refresh, rather than one chunk per click.
