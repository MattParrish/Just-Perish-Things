Welcome to Hopper! The new, awesome, totally-not-Frogger game that everyone is raving about!

After starting the game, you're welcomed with a splash art page, and a prompt asking if you really do want to play. 
The only options that the main screen will accept is either a y or a n, correlating to if you want to play (caps are accepted too).
After you hit that yes, you want to play, the map will be moved forward 0 to 10 turns, and then printed out.
From there, use W/A/S/D to move around (lower case. Caps not taken), and enter to confirm.

The goal is to make it across the road without getting hit by the cars, across the river without falling in, then making it to the land on the far side!
Good luck, brave Hopper! 


Known bugs: 
Rarely will not move player up into victory lane, but will display victory text.
